Hello there! I am Santosh Suvarna, a senior web developer with expertise in .NET, PHP, and JSS based applications. Along with my programming skills, I also possess knowledge of AWS and have deployed applications on the platform. However, I believe there is always room for improvement and growth, which is why I am excited to be a part of this course to learn more about DevOps and CI/CD. I am eager to expand my knowledge and skills in this field and take on new challenges.
